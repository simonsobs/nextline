class CoroutineRunner:
    """Execute the coroutine in the asyncio event loop at the instantiation

    A running asyncio event loop needs to exist in the thread in which this
    class is instantiated. The method run() can be called in any thread,
    regardless of whether the same thread in which this class is instantiated or
    any other thread. In either case, the coroutine given to run() will be
    executed in the event loop in the thread in which this class is
    instantiated.

    This class can be useful when you need to run coroutines in the asyncio
    event loop in a particular thread but events that require the coroutines to
    run can occur any threads.
